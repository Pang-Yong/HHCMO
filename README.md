# HHCMO
HHCMO is the surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm for the constrained multi-objective optimization problem with highly heterogeneous evaluations. Highly heterogeneous evaluations mean that the optimization problem has both the expensive objective and constraints that need the approximation by the surrogate model and the inexpensive objective and constraints that can be written as the explicit functions. The difference between HHCBO and HHCMO is that the HHCBO is designed for two objectives and HHCMO is designed for any number of objectives. 

The algorithm is coded using Matlab toolbox PlatEMO 3.0: Tian, Ye, et al. "PlatEMO: A MATLAB platform for evolutionary multi-objective optimization [educational forum]." IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine 12.4 (2017): 73-87. This toolbox is also uploaded. More details for NSGAIII-EHVI are shown in the paper
